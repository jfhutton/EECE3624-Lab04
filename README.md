# Lab04
In this lab you will write an assembly language program to solve factorials. The program will include main code and a recursive subroutine. The main code is provided, and requires a particular calling convention when using the subroutine. Also, the only data passing mechanism you may use is the stack. Your subroutine cannot rely on getting data to or from the main program via registers or global memory, nor can it use registers or global memory to exchange intermediate values between recursive calls to itself. 

In addition to giving you practice designing programs involving recursion, this lab will give you additional experience using the Atmel Studio debugger as you monitor the processor and stack memory during program operation.

Have fun!
